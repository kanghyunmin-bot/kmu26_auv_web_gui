# AUV Web GUI

Web control panel for running AUV localization tests and real-vehicle pinger
homing from a browser.

The intended deployment is:

- Ubuntu robot PC runs ROS 2, MAVROS, DVL, EKF, this GUI server, and bag recording.
- MacBook opens the web page over Ethernet.
- MacBook ROS `joy_node` can publish `/joy` over DDS, while this GUI monitors `/joy` health from the robot PC.

## One-click Run

On the Ubuntu robot PC:

```bash
./kmu26_auv_web_gui/scripts/start_kmu26_auv_web_gui.sh
```

To add a desktop/app launcher on Ubuntu:

```bash
./kmu26_auv_web_gui/scripts/install_desktop_launcher.sh
```

After that, open **KMU26 AUV Web GUI** from the app menu or desktop icon.

## ROS Run

```bash
ros2 run kmu26_auv_web_gui server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

Then open:

```text
http://<ubuntu-robot-ip>:8080
```

## Pinger Homing tab

The **Pinger Homing** tab starts the standalone `kmu26_pinger_homing` ROS 2
package, shows its estimator/controller/RC-mux status, and supports a safe dry
run before live MAVROS RC output.

Place both repositories in the same ROS 2 workspace and build them:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/2026-kmu-underwater-robot/kmu26_mission_fsm.git
git clone https://github.com/2026-kmu-underwater-robot/kmu26_auv_web_gui.git
cd ~/catkin_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select kmu26_pinger_homing kmu26_auv_web_gui
source install/setup.bash
```

Start the robot stack first. The GUI routes joystick RC through
`/control/joystick/rc_override`, while the pinger controller uses
`/control/pinger/rc_override`; the RC mux remains the sole publisher to
`/mavros/rc/override`.

Recommended sequence on the physical robot:

1. Open the Pinger Homing tab and use **Start Dry Run**.
2. Confirm fresh odometry, MAVROS, hydrophone direction, and audio status.
3. Stop the dry run, choose a vehicle mode, and arm only after the propeller
   area is clear.
4. Run **Preflight**, then use **Start Live RC** only when every check passes.
5. Use **Stop** or **DISARM** at any time to release RC output.

`Success range` must stay `0` until `IQ range constant` has been calibrated on
the real hydrophone. `Tank max depth` is the known tank depth used by the
controller's vertical search safety logic.

### Real-vehicle contract checked by Preflight

The live preflight validates the physical stack contract, not only topic
names:

| Signal | Required contract |
| --- | --- |
| Odometry | `/odometry/filtered`, `nav_msgs/msg/Odometry`, `odom -> base_link` |
| Depth | `/depth/pose`, `geometry_msgs/msg/PoseWithCovarianceStamped`, frame `odom`, underwater `z < 0` |
| Vehicle | `/mavros/state`, `mavros_msgs/msg/State`, connected and armed |
| Services | `/mavros/cmd/arming` and `/mavros/set_mode` available |
| Audio | `/audio`, `audio_common_msgs/msg/AudioData`, or bundled capture enabled |
| RC output | no publisher before homing; the homing RC mux becomes the sole `/mavros/rc/override` publisher |

The latest `hit25_auv_ros2/localization_test.launch.py` supplies these topic,
frame, depth-sign, and joystick-mux contracts when the GUI starts the robot
stack. A failed row identifies the exact real-vehicle integration mismatch and,
for RC conflicts, the publisher node names.

## Python Dependencies

This package uses FastAPI and Uvicorn for the web server.

```bash
python3 -m pip install fastapi uvicorn
```
